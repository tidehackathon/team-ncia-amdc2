NCIA AMDC-2

Analytics Dashboard for Interoperability

initial thoughts: 
postgreSQL database to hold tables as given + views & derived tabbles
very thin middleware/backend (Flask) just to serve the front & the data
frontend: multi-tabbed singe page application usign HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, JQueryUI, D3js, Chartjs, etc...

KPI process:

define KPI, define data sources & views, define visualisation options, include in dashboard (layout)
